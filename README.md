# Velcome to Vector Village
This is where vectors come to clean up their act.

## Getting started
This is a really basic thing at present.
* Clone this Village
* Run `npm install`

## Optimize an svg
* Export your svg (from _Sketch_, _Illustrator_, WHATEVER) to the `slopper/` directory.
* Run `grunt svgmin` from your command line.
* Your goodies should be in the `proper/` directory.
